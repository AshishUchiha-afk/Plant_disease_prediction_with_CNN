# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and classify plant diseases from leaf images. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early detection of crop diseases using AI-powered image classification.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- ✅ Built using TensorFlow and Keras
- 🖼️ Trained on labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves
- 📊 Achieves high accuracy on test data
- 📦 Data preprocessing includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- 🧪 Includes train-test-validation split and model evaluation
- 📈 Plots for accuracy, loss, and model performance included


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy / Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional for image preprocessing)

## 📌 How It Works

1. Image dataset is preprocessed and augmented.
2. A CNN model is built and trained on the training set.
3. Model performance is validated using validation data.
4. Test images are evaluated, and predictions are made.
